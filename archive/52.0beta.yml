- note: <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The way images are included in a compose window
    has changed. Images are now included as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">data
    URIs</a> and not as references to parts of other messages or operating system
    files. This allows better interoperability with office packages such as MS Office
    or LibreOffice. Images linked from locations on the internet will <strong>no longer</strong>
    be downloaded and attached to the message automatically. This can be changed for
    each image individually via the Image Properties dialog or globally by setting
    the preference mail.compose.attach_http_images.
