- note: 'According to RFC 4616 and RFC 5721, passwords containing non-ASCII characters are
    encoded using UTF-8 which can lead to problems with non-compliant providers, for example
    office365.com. The SMTP LOGIN and POP3 USER/PASS authentication methods are now using
    a Latin-1 encoding again to work around this issue.'
