notes:
- note: '**ADD-ON SUPPORT: Restartless add-ons continue to work if their authors have made the necessary
    minor adjustments. Non-restartless legacy add-ons using XUL overlays are only supported if add-on
    authors have adapted them. ** Apart from Lightning/Calendar there are a few that have been
    adapted, like "ThunderHTMLedit", "Compact Header" and "Signature Switch".
    Instaling legacy add-ons now requires a restart. Legacy add-ons can now specify
    an options page again.'
  tag: changed
- note: '** DICTIONARY SUPPORT: Only WebExtension dictionaries are supported now.**
    Please download new dictionaries from addons.mozilla.org since
    addons.thunderbird.net still provides "legacy" dictionaries compatible
    with Thunderbird 60 ESR. Note that Thunderbird 60.5 ESR
    can also handle WebExtension dictionaries.'
