- note: Further improvements to attachments handling during compose, Alt+M now allows
    to show the attachment pane. The attachment pane can also be shown initially when
    composing a new message. Right-click on the header to enable this option.
    It is now also impossible to completely collapse a non-empty attachment pane.
    That protects against attachments accidentally being sent.
