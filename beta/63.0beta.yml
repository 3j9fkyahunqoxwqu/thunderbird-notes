- note: "**ADD-ON SUPPORT: As of Thunderbird version 63 beta non-restartless legacy add-on using XUL overlays
    are only supported if add-on authors have not adapted them. To our knowledge none of the effected add-ons
    except Thunderbird's own Lightning/Calendar add-on have been adapted so that no non-restartless add-on
    apart from Lighning will currently work. Restartless add-ons should continue to work if their authors
    have made the necessary minor adjustments.**"
